      <title>Split gRPC: An Isolation Architecture for RPC Stacks on SmartNICs</title>

      <description>It was an absolute pleasure to attend the Computational IO Workshop. Lots of great talks and great work presented!&#xA;Talk + Slides&#xA;Talk Blurb Remote procedure calls are a major contributor to performance variance in distributed systems due to lack of isolation and contention on shared resources. In this talk, I will introduce the novel architecture we built to address this problem, and cover our experience in implementing a prototype over gRPC with an emphasis on the communication layer between a host CPU and the SmartNIC.</description>

      <description>This project was completed as part of CSE-211 with Tyler Sorenson. Thanks for the great class!&#xA;It is not a controversial statement that we care very deeply about performance. The programs that we write must run efficiently on a diverse set of hardware whose local software state can be equally as diverse. Similarly, program behavior varies over its lifetime, evolving workloads result in very different &amp;ldquo;hot spots&amp;rdquo; in both instruction execution and memory usage in our programs.</description>
